Serving as the second largest commuter rail network in the United State, the NJ Transit spans New Jersey and the state to New York City. However, their delays are getting worse with more office workers returning, on the other hand, there are no interactive apps for commuters that can predict the immediate delays that may happen by chance or fixedly occur on their daily commute routes during the day. As such, they cannot foresee them instantly and mitigate accordingly.

In our project, we further investigate into the delay performance on NJ transitâ€™s commuter rail routes and come up with some interactive & instant predictive strategies targeted at commuters within NJ Transit Commuter Rail Routes.
